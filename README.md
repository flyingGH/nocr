NOCR is an open source library for text recognition in natural scenes, based on OpenCV. The library was written
in C++11 and is compatible with OpenCV library for computer vision. 

Library decomposes the main problem into two subproblems, and that is letter localization and word formatting using located letters. 

Library is enabling seamless integration of any algorithm for letter localization with one algorithm for word formation implemented in the library.
